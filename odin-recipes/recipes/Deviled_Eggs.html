    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the eggs up to 48 hours in advance. Peel, cut in half, and remove yolks. Place egg whites on tray, cover with plastic wrap, and store in fridge.</li>
        <li>Make yolk mixture according to recipe. Fill a zip-top bag or reusable piping bag with the yolk mixture. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible, and store in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Just before you're ready to serve, take the tray of egg whites and the yolk mixture from fridge. Gently knead the yolk mixture to recombine and warm it up slightly. (Cold filling won't pipe as well.)</li>
        <li>Clip a small piece from the corner of the plastic bag. Pipe the yolk mixture into each egg white. Garnish, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
